##Exercise 4
Describe what your application should do and which aspects will be reactive.

###Create fitness recipes

- Add feedback when a certain nutritional value is excessively present in a recipe.

####Reactive components
- When a recipe has been created it will be added to the live feed on the homepage.
- When an ingredient has been added to a recipe, the nutritional value will immediately be updated.
